# Container with most water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        ans = 0
        while l < r:
            area = min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l)
            ans = max(ans, area)
            if height[l] <= height[r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        return ans
